## Introduction
This Python script is designed for demosaicing raw images captured by digital cameras. Demosaicing is the process of converting raw sensor data into a full-color image by interpolating missing color information. This script uses the OpenCV library to perform the demosaicing.

## Features
- Demosaicing of raw sensor data into full-color images.
- Support for various Bayer patterns, such as BGGR, RGGB, etc.
- Simple and easy-to-use Python script.
- Option to specify input and output image paths.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**

    - Clone this repository to local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/Kaishays/Demosaicing_Python

2. **Install OpenCV**

    - Make sure OpenCV is installed in your Python environment. Install using `pip`: pip3 install opencv-python

3. **Configure path.py**

    - Set user_input_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
    - Set user_output_path = "path/to/output"

- **If steps were correctly followed Demosaic.py will convert raw sensor data into full-color images.**
